# Pywal for Sublime

This is a simple script for generating Sublime color schemes. For the best possible experience use it with an adaptive theme (eg. the built-in one or maybe this [this](https://github.com/pradyun/Sublime-Rainbow-Theme))

It's actually the first thing I've written in my life that can be at least remotely useful for someone. I hope it's not too bad!
