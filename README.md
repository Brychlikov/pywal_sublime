# Pywal for Sublime

This is a simple script for generating Sublime color schemes. For the best possible experience use it with an adaptive theme (eg. the built-in one or maybe this [this](https://github.com/pradyun/Sublime-Rainbow-Theme))

I've chosen colors to be assigned more or less at random, but it looks decent.

It's actually the first thing I've written in my life that can be at least remotely useful for someone. I hope it's not too bad!
